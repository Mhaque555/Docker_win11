# ðŸªŸ Windows 11 Docker Container (KVM-based)

This project allows you to easily run a lightweight Windows 11 container using Docker with KVM support on a Linux system. No `.env` file is required â€” all configuration is built into the setup script.

- A Linux system with KVM virtualization support
  - To check if KVM is supported, run:
